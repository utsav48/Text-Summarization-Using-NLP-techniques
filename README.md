# Text-Summarization-Using-NLP-techniques

In today’s digital age, the volume of data produced
daily is staggering, with 90% of the world’s data generated in
just the past two years alone 1
. With ever-growing digital media,
there is not enough time to read through entire articles, blogs, or
e-books to decide if they contain helpful information. Automatic
Text Summarization solves the problem of the overabundance
of digital content. By generating shorter, focused summaries
of larger documents, individuals can quickly determine if the
content contains the information they need. Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques have proven to be a promising
solution to this problem, making it possible to summarize large
volumes of digital content efficiently.
In this project, we aim to predict summaries based on
the text with the help of 3 different strategies:- two different
architectures from the Sequence-to-sequence model and the Textto-Text Transfer Transformer (T5). Through these approaches,
we aim to gain insights into the characteristics of the resulting
summaries and evaluate their quality using metrics.
